# Matrices

```{r}
# creating a vector from 1 to 23, length 24
vec1 <- 1:24
# Note that 6*4=24
# byrow determines how the matrix is being populated
mat1 <- matrix(data = vec1, nrow = 6,ncol = 4, byrow = F)
mat1
```

# Array

```{r}
# this array exists of 2 matrices with 3 rows and 4 columns, this is defined in dim
# the values come from the vector
arr1 <- array(data = vec1, dim = c(3, 4, 2))
arr1
```

```{r}
arr2 <- arr1
# Here we see an array witht he same values, but different dimensions
dim(arr2) <- c(2, 2, 6)
arr2
```
